**Welcome to the Text Automater App Project!**

You might be wondering why you need to download this app from outside the Play Store. Let me explain why:

## Why Not the Play Store?

1. **Google's Rules**: Google has certain rules about what apps can and can't do. One of these rules says that apps can’t automatically send messages or use some special features of other apps like WhatsApp. This is mainly to keep things secure and prevent misuse.

2. **Our App’s Special Features**: The Text Automater App uses special features to help you send messages automatically. Because of these features, Google’s rules would not let us put the app on the Play Store.

## Why Are We Offering It This Way?

1. **Helping You More**: We wanted to create an app that helps with sending messages automatically. To do this, we need to use features that aren’t allowed on the Play Store. By offering the app outside of it, we can provide you with the exact help you need.

2. **Transparency and Trust**: We believe in being open about how our app works. That’s why we’ve put the app’s code on GitHub. You can see exactly how it works and make sure it's safe. We want you to feel confident and trust that the app does what we say it does.

3. **For People Who Need It**: This app is designed for users who genuinely need these features. By offering it outside the Play Store, we can help those who need it most without being limited by the Play Store’s restrictions.

## How to Get the App Safely

1. **Download from Our Website or GitHub**: You can download the app directly from our website or GitHub page. We’ve made sure that the download is safe and easy.

2. **Installation Instructions**: We provide clear instructions on how to install the app. It’s simple and straightforward to set up.

3. **We’re Here to Help**: If you have any questions or run into issues, we’re here to assist you. Just reach out, and we’ll guide you through any steps you need.

In summary, the Text Automater App is available outside the Play Store because it uses features not allowed by Google’s rules. We’re offering it this way to give you the best help possible and to be transparent about how the app works.
